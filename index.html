<h1>Hi there</h1>
<p>There would probably be more here if Google sites wasn't a clone
of freewebs but since I'm forced to use this limited method of editing
web pages instead of full blown html, I'm only going to say this is a
place-holder.</p>
<p>It's better than the ad-ridden landing page my domain registrar
gave me that's for sure!</p>
<p>Look, cheer up! I will eventually manage to sort out some hosting
and we'll have something more impressive here.</p>
<h2>What is this anyway?</h2>
<p>It's simple really. I bought a domain because I needed a more professional
email and my old one was very long to type out. I was forced to use my
university email when applying for internships and communicating as a customer
which is less than ideal because when I graduate it becomes difficult to direct
people to a permanent address.</p>
<p>Also, who is going to get a job with an email address like
<code>happyburger69@hotmail.com</code> (not my address thank goodness).</p>
<h2>Why this name though?</h2>
<p>Simple. it's short which means I can have an address like <code>email@gxi.me</code> and
use subdomains like <code>name.gxi.me</code> and it will be just as long as having the
domain name.uk.com which is pretty neat.</p>
<p>The <code>gxi</code> doesn't really mean anything. It was originally supposed to be
something like <code>g90</code> since it's easy to remember a number but when I typed it
the number made the domain look strange. The memorable domain names have pretty
much all been taken by domain speculators looking to get rich and even the domain
hacks like <code>grah.am</code> are all taken.</p>
<p>The <code>.me</code> TLD actually is actually country code for Montenegro but the domain is
marketed and used like the <code>.name</code> TLD. I chose it because <code>.com</code> is pretty much used
up and I don't want to be bound by geographical/national distinction.</p>
